Problems to go over with James

ex17 - i am beginning to make sense of this although i am having problems running the file - segmentation faults? after reading about it, i am unsure why it is affecting my code. 

also, i think it may be something to do with fopen but having looked in the library i am again finding it hard to see the problem.

what is going on with prototypes?

i keep getting the error message that RoomProto is undeclared - i find this confusing - i can't see how what i have done is different to the code on LCTHW

i kind of get what is going on in the program 

i need deeper understanding of void *self which is the argument for about a million functions

i need to discuss the way the header files interrelate

i need deeper understanding of the -> thing and need to look at how that is being used here.
